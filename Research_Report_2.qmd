# 1. Introduction

Research Report 2 focuses on Ensemble Learning Techniques for Fair Classification.

As Machine Learning (ML) Systems become more integrated into society, their development and implementation continue to come under scrutiny. One aspect of this scrutiny comes from the idea of fairness, that Machine Learning models should treat people fairly, regardless of characteristics. Usually, this refers to a protected class, such as race, gender, or ethnicity. In broader contexts, it can also refer to other factors such as income.

# 2. Fairness

An example of fairness in life is what we hope to see in the justice system. Every person, regardless of who they are or what their background is, should in theory have the law applied equally and impartially, as well as be given the means to access the legal system. The color of someone’s skin, their income, their gender identity, whether their favorite day of the week is Wednesday, none of this should affect their ability to have a just and impartial time in the justice system.

In an ML context, fairness means that a model’s outputs/predictions do not systemically disadvantage certain groups based on demographic information. The most straight-forward method of achieving this is demographic parity across different subgroups. This means that each subgroup of race, gender, etc., receives the positive outcome at equal rates.

There are other contexts of fairness, such as fairness in pricing, which deals with pricing algorithms and how to properly balance them between societal equity and the supply-and-demand of the private sector. However, that is outside the purview of this report.

## 2.1 Examples of Unfairness

Below are two examples of societal unfairness baked into ML Systems.

### 2.1.1 COMPAS

The COMPAS algorithm developed by the firm Equivant is commonly used by judges and forecasts which criminals are most likely to reoffend, using a quantitative approach to fairness. Although it was correctly predicting recidivism rates for defendants regardless of rates (a good True Positive rate), it was scoring black people who would not re-offend at twice the risk of recidivism as their white counterparts (bad False Positive rate). While Equivant argued that because their model was correctly predicting recidivism rates when a defendant did reoffend, it proved their model was unbiased. ProPublica, who led the research into their model’s False Positives, argued against the misclassification based on race that occurred in the model.

### 2.1.2 Amazon

Amazon has been implementing ML Systems in many of its processes for years now. One of these processes, their hiring process, came under scrutiny in 2018 after their ML team discovered that the model used to “rate” candidates in the hiring process was discriminating against women. This was due to the tech industry in-general being largely made up of men, which was reflected in the resumes submitted to the company over a 10-year period. The model effectively self-taught itself to be more male-centric, penalizing resumes that had terms such as “women” in the scoring metric (ie if the resume said "captain of women's chess team"). This is also a reflection of how the STEM field is in-general, which is a mostly male-dominated industry, hence why most of the resumes coming in were from men. This is an example of societal bias being used in an ML context.

## 2.2 Measuring Fairness

A common approach to measuring fairness is the aforementioned deviation from demographic parity. If we divide the populations into two groups, $G_1$ and $G_2$, the deviation from demographic parity associated with a classifier $f : R^p \rightarrow {0,1}$ is given by:

$$
\text{DDP}(f) = \left| \frac{1}{|G_1|} \sum_{i \in G_1} f(x_i) - \frac{1}{|G_2|} \sum_{i \in G_2} f(x_i) \right|
= \left| \mathbb{E}_{x \sim G_1}[f(x)] - \mathbb{E}_{x \sim G_2}[f(x)] \right|
$$

# 3. Diabetes Dataset

To research the potential of bias in a social context (and by extent, in a ML System), I picked a dataset from UC Irvine’s Machine Learning Repository. The dataset represents ten years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. Each row concerns hospital records of patients diagnosed with diabetes, who underwent laboratory, medications, and stayed up to 14 days.

## 3.1 Target Class

The target class in this dataset is the `READMITTED` column which has three values: `No`, `<30` and `>30`. This feature asks whether a patient was readmitted following their initial hospital visit within 30 days (early readmission) or after 30 days (general readmission). Its raw data contains 101,766 records with 50 columns ($101,766 \space \times \space 50$) and a secondary spreadsheet used to connect three `id` columns in the data to an English meaning (ie `admission_type_id = 1` is an `Emergency`).

This target was turned into two potential target-y classes: `readmit_early` and `readmit_at_all`. The former is just the values of `<30` while the latter is either `<30` or `>30`. Without any data cleaning or feature engineering, the class imbalance for `readmit_early` is about 88.8% : 11.2% for 0 : 1, while `readmit_at_all` is about 53.9% : 46.1% for 0 : 1. Although there is value in looking into `readmit_early` as a target, the class imbalance widens following the data cleaning section and it becomes a virtually untenable target class without any sort of artificial balancing such as the SMOTE method.

As a note: the data cleaning and EDA was done in Python to create the eventual modeling data. The full cleaning and EDA code can be [found on my GitHub](https://github.com/SethKauf/STA9890-Prediction-Competition/blob/r2/Workfiles/Report_2_Workfile.ipynb) if interested.

</div>

## 3.2 Data Cleaning

The first step to dealing with the data was cleaning it. This started by checking for NULLs, which in this dataset was denoted by the presence of `?` in the data. Only 7 of the 50 original features have NULLs. `race`, `diag_1`, `diag_2`, and `diag_3` (diagnoses 1, 2 and 3 respectively) have < 3% of their records as NULL. `payer_code` and `medical_specialty` (insurance provider and medical specialty of the overseeing physician) are about 40% `NULL`.

<div class="center-image" style="text-align: center;">
![NULL counts represented by "?"](images/rr2/null_count.png)
</div>

For these 6 columns, I elected to remove all records with the `NULL` values in any of these columns. This removed about 40% of the data, bringing the total number of records down to 48,140.

The 7th column, weight, was comprised of nearly 97% NULL data. Once I accounted for the NULLs in the first 6 columns, only about 3,000 of the 48,140 records actually had a filled value for weight. This is actually extremely unfortunate as weight is both a demographic feature and an especially important feature in something like diabetes. However, there is simply too much data lost by keeping it at the expense of ~45,000 records, while imputation of some sort (ie mean, forward fill, random-fill, etc. imputation) would be too sketchy given the sheer volume of NULL values. Because of this, the `weight` feature has been completely dropped from the model.

Another consideration in the dataset is that some patients are “repeat” patients. Looking at the distribution of these patients, we see most only visit the hospital once, with a median of 1, an upper bound on the IQR of 2, and a mean of ~1.49 visits. With this in mind, any patient whose number appears in the data more than 3 times was removed. Further, because this still means there are some duplicates, when it comes time to split the data, it will be split on `patient_nbr` to avoid patients appearing in both the training and testing data.

</div>

## 3.3 Feature Engineering

The next step was to engineer some features using standard techniques:

* Categorical encoding

  - Really just left the `id` columns as-is for this one
 
  - Debatable if this is a good idea or not since there’s no inherent order to the numbers
 
* Ordinal encoding

  - Encoding the age-brackets to a 0-9 scale
 
* Dummy encoding

  - `race` $\rightarrow$ `race_AfricanAmerican`, `race_Caucasian`…
 
* Binarizing

  - Glucose Levels $\rightarrow$ High Glucose Indicator
 
* Scaling numeric data

  - Ie num_visists
 
* “Other” grouping

  - Threshold for diagnoses columns at < 100 instances
 
  - Threshold for race, medical_specialty, payer_code at < 1000 instances

## 3.4 Feature Selection

With the NULL values dealt with and the features engineered, the final step before modeling was feature selection. Due to the dummy encoding, there were a few hundred features to choose from. Most of these new features were based on the diagnoses 1-3 columns, since they each had a lot of values. With this in mind, checking the correlation between those dummy columns and the y-target `readmit_at_all`, only the top-50 diagnoses features were kept based on absolute correlation. These 50 diagnoses features and 37 other features, including dummy encoded race variables, age brackets and gender, were kept in the modeling data. The final dataset contains both potential y targets of readmit_at_all and readmit_early, however, the latter (along with `patient_nbr`) is dropped once it comes time to modeling.

# 4. Base Learner Models

To create a FairStacks Ensemble model in *Section 5*, the first step is to build several Base Learner Models that will eventually be stacked into the ensemble. A diverse array of model types can be used here. Below are 5 model types along with Confusion Matrices of their respective predictions.

```{r install-packages_[0], echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| code-fold: TRUE
# libraries
library(caret)
library(CVXR)
library(dplyr)
library(e1071)
library(ggplot2)
library(MASS)
library(patchwork)
library(readr)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(tibble)
library(yardstick)
```

## 4.1 Read in Data

Data Dimensions:

```{r read-data_[1], echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| code-fold: TRUE
# load in encoded data
data <- read_csv('data/RR2/modeling_data_encoded.csv')

dim(data) # 48,140 x 89
```

Train-Test-Split
```{r train-test-split_[2], echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| code-fold: TRUE
# remove the secondary y-target
data <- data |>
  dplyr::select(-readmit_early)

y <- data$readmit_at_all
X <- data |> dplyr::select(-readmit_at_all)

set.seed(42)

# TRAIN TEST SPLIT #

# need to separate by patient_nbr so same patients don't end up in train and target
patient_ids <- unique(data$patient_nbr)
train_ids <- sample(patient_ids, size = 0.8 * length(patient_ids))

train_data <- data |> filter(patient_nbr %in% train_ids)
test_data <- data |> filter(!(patient_nbr %in% train_ids))

# drop patient_nbr
train_data <- train_data |> dplyr::select(-patient_nbr)
test_data <- test_data |> dplyr::select(-patient_nbr)
```

# 5. FairStacks Ensemble

Ensemble learning combines models into a sort-of *super model* in one of three ways: stacking, bagging and boosting. FairStacks is a stacking framework that will add a *Fairness Penalty* to the model stack.

A standard ensemble might stack the model with an algorithm like:

$\hat w = argmin_w \frac {1} {n} \Sigma^n_{i=1}Loss(y,\Sigma_j,w_j \hat f_j (x_i))$

The FairStacks model adds a "Fairness Penalty" similar to what we might see in an $\ell_1$-regression model, so the algorithm looks like:

$\hat w = argmin_w \frac {1} {n} \Sigma^n_{i=1}Loss(y,\Sigma_j,w_j \hat f_j (x_i))+\lambda |\Sigma_j w_j \hat b_j|$

For this algorithm, a larger $\lambda$ value is used to force the "average bias" down to zero, resulting in a fairer ensemble.

## 5.1 Regular Stack

First, let's see what a regular stacked model would look like without the fairness penalty.

```{r regular-stack_[8], echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| code-fold: TRUE

  1 / (1 + exp(-x))

prob_pred_tree <- tree_probs[, "1"]

# Combine all model probabilities using correct variable names
ensemble_train <- data.frame(
  nb           = nb_prob,
  lda          = lda_pred$posterior[, 2],
  svm          = as.numeric(prob_pred_svm),

  logreg_ridge = as.numeric(prob_pred_ridge),
  logreg_lasso = as.numeric(prob_pred_lasso)
)

# Normalize each prediction (min-max scaling)

## 5.2 FairStacks

Now comparing the regular stack to a FairStack:

# 6. Conclusion
Although the FairStack model performs slightly worse in-terms of predictions than its more-biased counterpart, reducing the bias across features in this model, which includes demographic/characteristic features of race, age and gender, allows for a more socially-equitable model than the former.
